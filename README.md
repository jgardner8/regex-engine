A regular expression engine created for learning purposes. Could serve as a good reference for how a regular expression engine works.

Uses a recursive descent parser to create an AST. 
Has three evaluation methods:
	* Derivatives
	* Non-deterministic finite automata (NFA)
	* Deterministic finite automata (DFA)
